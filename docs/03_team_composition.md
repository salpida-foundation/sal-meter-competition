# Team Composition Guide  
## Sal-Meter Open Competition (Track A / B / C)

This document defines **who should participate in each track** of the Sal-Meter Open Competition,  
and—equally important—**who should not**.

This is not a motivational brochure.  
It is a **filter**.

## Track A — Full-System CAIS Prototype Team

> **Self-assessment note:**  
> Track A assumes a fully capable, senior-level system development team.  
> If you are unsure whether your team qualifies for Track A, you probably do not.


### Who this track is for

Track A is intended for **serious, well-resourced research teams** capable of delivering a **complete CAIS-compliant Sal-Meter prototype**.

You should consider Track A **only if** your team can confidently answer “yes” to all of the following:

- We can allocate **6–9 months of sustained effort**
- We can cover **~USD 1M total development cost** (the prize is partial compensation, not funding)
- We already have **cross-domain experience** (hardware + chemistry + signal + validation)
- We are comfortable working under **fixed, non-negotiable canonical standards**

### Recommended core roles (all must be covered)

- Biosensor / Chemistry (Aptamer, redox, iodine systems) ×2  
- Signal Processing / ML / AI ×2–3  
- Hardware / Electronics Engineer ×1  
- Statistics / Validation Specialist ×1  
- Project Lead / Systems Integrator ×1  

> Headcount is flexible. **Role coverage is not.**

### Who should NOT apply to Track A

- Teams seeking seed funding
- Teams expecting to redefine CAIS or Sal-Meter standards
- Teams without prior multi-disciplinary integration experience
- Teams unwilling to publish validation results openly

If any of the above applies, **Track A is not recommended**.

---

## Track B — Modular Subsystem or Validation Track

### Who this track is for

Track B is designed for **focused research groups** that excel in **one strong domain**, such as:

- Sensor module development
- Signal processing or statistical modeling
- Hardware subsystems
- Validation pipelines

This track rewards **depth over breadth**.

### Typical team profile

- 3–5 researchers or engineers
- Clear ownership of **one CAIS-compatible module**
- Ability to deliver **quantitative, reproducible results**

Track B teams are **not expected** to build a full Sal-Meter system.

### When Track B is the correct choice

- You want meaningful contribution without full-system risk
- Your lab already has relevant infrastructure
- You want publication-quality results within a bounded scope

---

## Track C — Exploratory / Individual / Entry Track

### Who this track is for

Track C is the **default low-risk entry point**.

It is suitable for:

- Individual researchers
- PhD students or postdocs
- Small exploratory teams
- Researchers curious but not yet committed

### Characteristics

- Time commitment: **3–6 months (flexible)**
- Scope: **one clearly bounded experiment or prototype**
- No requirement to escalate to Track B or A

Track C is intentionally permissive, **but not unserious**.

### What Track C is NOT

- A hobby contest with no standards
- A sandbox to ignore CAIS definitions
- A shortcut to Track A funding

Escalation is **earned through data**, not intent.

## Summary Decision Table

| Question | If your answer is “yes” | Recommended Track |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Can we build a full CAIS system? | Yes | Track A |
| Can we deliver a strong subsystem? | Yes | Track B |
| Are we exploring feasibility? | Yes | Track C |
| Do we want funding without constraints? | Yes | Do not apply |

---

## Final Guidance

If you are uncertain between tracks, **start with Track C**.

Track escalation is:
- Optional
- Data-driven
- Non-punitive

There is no advantage to overcommitting early.
