# Sal-Meter Open Competition  
## 4-Phase Execution Plan (Research-Centric Edition)

This document defines the **four-phase execution roadmap for development, validation, and downstream expansion** of the Sal-Meter Open Competition.

The program is not a conventional technology contest or idea pitch.  
It is designed as a **large-scale, coordinated scientific challenge** addressing a question that has not yet been reproducibly resolved:

**Can consciousness-related signals be materially separated, measured, and validated under shared constraints?**

Multiple independent research teams are invited to explore this question in parallel, under a fixed architectural and governance framework, producing results that remain scientifically valid whether they succeed, partially succeed, or establish clear boundaries of failure.

Participants are positioned to:
- Occupy an **early, leading research role** in an undeveloped measurement domain  
- Retain full academic authorship and scientific responsibility for their results  
- Work within an already fixed CAIS structure while maintaining **freedom of implementation**

This execution plan is fully aligned—in tone, scope, and intent—with the following **five official Figshare reference documents**:

## Phase 0 — Baseline Fixation and Participation Preparation  
**Timing:** Approximately months 0–3 after program launch  
**Character:** Definition fixation · orientation

### Objective
- Permanently fix *what is being built* and *what is being tested*
- Eliminate interpretive ambiguity so that participants can focus purely on implementation and experimentation

### Core Activities
1. Final fixation of canonical boundaries  
   - Sal-Meter Canonical Definition v1.0  
     https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18452075  
   - Sal-Meter Negative Definition v1.0  
     https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18452694  
   - CAIS Compliance Boundary v1.0  

2. Consolidation of non-canonical technical helper materials  
   - CAIS Architecture & Sal-Meter Technical Snapshot v1.0  
     https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.31287529

3. Preparation of public participation infrastructure

   - https://github.com/salpida-foundation/sal-meter-competition-kr

4. Clarification of SICS oversight and independent validation roles  
5. International research outreach and formal program announcement

### Meaning of This Phase
- No performance or deliverable requirements  
- A decision window for prospective participants  
- The evaluation logic follows the **PI Quick Decision Pack**  
  https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.31287268

## Phase 1 — Team Entry and Track Structuring  
**Timing:** Approximately months 3–6 after launch  
**Character:** Participant confirmation · role differentiation

### Objective
- Form multiple independent experimental cohorts rather than a single winner pathway  
- Enable diverse technical approaches to address the same measurement question concurrently

### Participation Tracks
- **Track A** — Full CAIS-level system implementations  
- **Track B** — Partial modules, sensors, signal pipelines, or subsystems  
- **Track C** — Independent exploratory, theoretical, or open experimental work

### Operating Principles
- Selection is not based on competitive ranking  
- The only criterion is whether a team can responsibly execute a real implementation  
- Track C remains continuously open throughout the program

### Motivation Structure
- Entry immediately places teams within an official comparative experiment set  
- Failure, boundary results, and partial success all retain scientific value

## Phase 2 — Development and Experimental Exploration  
**Timing:** Approximately months 6–15 after launch  
**Character:** Exploratory build · experimental validation

### Objective
- Attempt working implementations within the CAIS framework  
- Explicitly identify feasible ranges, failure points, and structural limits

### Track A
- Initial architecture → sensor and signal integration → iterative testing  
- Small internal test groups permitted  
- Structural coherence prioritized over polish or completeness

### Track B
- Reusable modules, components, or algorithms  
- Emphasis on interoperability and comparative reuse

### Track C
- Open publication of code, experimental notes, and conceptual trials  
- Seminars, working documents, and informal reports  
- Journal submission is optional, not required

  https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.31281836

### Core Message
- This phase asks participants to **attempt**, not to prove  
- No assumption of success  
- Successful outcomes, if achieved, carry substantial academic impact

---

## Phase 3 — Independent Validation and Comparative Review  
**Timing:** Approximately months 15–21 after launch  
**Character:** Third-party validation · open comparison

### Objective
- Subject selected implementations to independent, reproducible verification  
- Compare differing technical strategies under shared constraints

### Validation Outline
- Limited participant cohorts  
- Blind or masked measurement conditions  
- Only the minimum statistical criteria required by CAIS are applied

### Output Handling
- Data and methods publicly released  
- Registration on OSF and open repositories  
- Journal submission encouraged but not mandatory

### Governing Principle
- Positive, partial, and negative outcomes are all formally recorded  
- Demonstrating limits is considered a valid scientific contribution

---

## Phase 4 — Optional Expansion and Follow-On Pathways  
**Timing:** After completion of Phase 3  
**Character:** Voluntary extension

### Purpose
- Explore next steps only where reproducibility has been demonstrated

### Possible Directions
- Multi-institution replication studies  
- Research-only or non-clinical regulatory exploration  
- Transition into longer-term programs or independent initiatives

### Explicit Boundary
- Phase 4 participation is optional  
- All standardization, regulatory, and institutional responsibilities remain with **SICS**  
- Participants remain focused on research, not compliance management

---

## Program Character Statement

- This is **not** a prize-driven competition  
- It **is** a rare opportunity to define the experimental boundary of a new measurement domain  
- Success is not assumed, but  
  successful validation establishes a reference baseline for the field  
- Failure and boundary results are treated as legitimate scientific outputs
