⚠️ **Non-canonical index**

All authority resides exclusively in **DOI-registered canonical records**.  
Nothing in this repository defines standards, compliance, certification, or authority.

This index exists **only** to support orientation and voluntary participation.

## What This Page Is For

This page is a **routing index**, not documentation.

If you are here, your next step should be **one of the following**:
- Decide whether this competition fits your lab
- Verify canonical authority and boundaries
- Identify a minimal, non-obligatory contribution
- Or leave without participation

All outcomes are valid.

## For Principal Investigators (30-minute decision)

If you need to decide quickly whether this competition fits your lab or research agenda,
**do not start with the full README**.

Begin here:

- **PI Quick Decision Pack (2 pages)**  
  docs/PI_Quick_Decision_Pack.md  

Designed to enable a **PI-level go / no-go decision within 30 minutes**.  
If the answer is “maybe”, it can be shared directly in a lab meeting as-is.
