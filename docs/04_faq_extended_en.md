# Frequently Asked Questions (Extended FAQ)

This document provides detailed answers to frequently asked questions about the Sal-Meter Open Competition.

---

## 1. Judging Panel and SICS Role

### Q1. Who selects the judges?

A. SICS (Salpida Institute of Consciousness Science) constitutes a panel of **7–9 independent judges**. This panel comprises external experts from the following disciplines:

- Biosensors
- Aptamers
- AI and Machine Learning
- Statistics
- Systems Engineering
- Ethics

**Independence Criteria:**

- No direct financial interest in participating teams
- No institutional affiliation with participating organizations during the competition period
- SICS personnel **cannot serve on the Technical Judging Panel**

---

### Q2. What is SICS's role in the judging process?

A. SICS functions solely as a **constitutional oversight body**. Specifically:

**SICS does:**

- Mediate disputes related to CAIS standard interpretation
- Maintain interpretation consistency of canonical documents (CAIS, Sal-Meter standards, etc.)
- Resolve conflicts between teams and judges

**SICS does not:**

- Score prototypes
- Rank teams
- Directly determine prize/fund allocation

> In summary, SICS is the "keeper of rules," not both "referee and player" simultaneously.

### Q3. What are the judging criteria?

A. The judging panel evaluates based on the following criteria:

| Category | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| CAIS Compliance | 25% | Adherence to CAIS v1.0, CAIS Compliance Boundary, and other technical standards |
| Technical Performance | 40% | Quantitative metrics (sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility) |
| Innovation | 20% | Novel approaches within CAIS boundaries, scalability potential |
| Open-Source Contribution | 10% | Documentation quality, reproducibility, openness degree |
| CCF Alignment | 5% | Alignment with CCF (Consciousness Civilization Framework) |

**Critical:** Teams that violate mandatory standards (CAIS, Compliance Boundary, etc.) are **automatically disqualified**.

---

### Q4. Can SICS bias scoring in favor of a particular team?

A. The structure is designed to minimize such possibility:

1. **Judge Independence**
   - SICS personnel cannot participate in technical evaluation
   - Anyone with conflicts of interest (financial or institutional) is excluded

2. **Separation of Powers**
   - "Rule design/interpretation (SICS)" is separated from "technical evaluation (independent panel)"
   - No single institution controls both rules and scoring

3. **Result Transparency**
   - Final CRO validation results and key performance data are published on GitHub, OSF, and other open repositories
   - The validation process itself remains on public record

4. **Dispute Resolution**
   - If teams challenge scoring, SICS Council reviews based on CAIS/charter standards
   - Only "rule compliance" is reconsidered, not score adjustment

---

## 2. CRO (Independent Validation Organization) Relationship

### Q5. Who conducts the final validation?

A. All finalist teams must submit prototypes to an independent **Contract Research Organization (CRO)**.

**Validation Cohort Example:**

- Total: 50 participants
- High VCE group: 25 participants
- Low VCE group: 25 participants

The CRO serves as **"measurement executor"** only and:

- Cannot reinterpret CAIS specifications
- Cannot propose new models
- Cannot independently determine certification

Interpretation authority resides solely with:

- Canonical documents
- Designer (Architect, Dr. Jinho Lee)

---

## 3. Team Composition and Participation Forms

### Q6. Must Track A teams have exactly 7 members?

A. The recommended composition is **7 members + advisory board**, but it is not mandatory. However, the following roles should be covered:

- Biosensor/Chemistry (2)
- Signal Processing/AI (2–3)
- Hardware Engineer (1)
- Statistics/Validation Specialist (1)
- Project Manager (1)

The key is "all roles covered," not a specific headcount.

---

### Q7. Can Korean teams or international mixed teams participate?

A. Yes. There are no nationality restrictions, and **international collaboration is actively encouraged**. If time zones align, researchers from multiple countries can form a single team.

---

### Q8. Can inexperienced students participate?

A. Yes. The recommended structure is:

- **Track A/B:** Leadership roles require 2–3+ years of professional/research experience; students participate in supporting roles
- **Track C:** Students, individuals, and hobbyist developers are welcome to participate freely

Students can build experience in Track C before advancing to Track A/B in later rounds.

---

## 4. Prize Money and Research Funding Relationship

### Q9. Can the prize cover all research costs?

A. No. As official documents state, the prize is **"completion compensation,"** not total research funding.

**Example (Track A team):**

- Expected personnel costs: ~USD 630,000 (9 months)
- Other costs (parts, lab, etc.): ~USD 270,000
- **Total funding needed:** ~USD 900,000
- **Prize:** USD 300,000 (if successful)

Teams must independently secure additional funding (university research grants, corporate R&D budgets, external funding, etc.).
