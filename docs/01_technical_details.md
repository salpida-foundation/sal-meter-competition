## Purpose of this document
This document provides a **technical orientation** for researchers and engineers considering participation in the **Sal-Meter Open Competition**.

It is intentionally **not** a full specification or implementation guide.

Its role is to help a technical reader understand:

- **What** is being measured  
- **How** it is measured (at a system level)  
- **Where** meaningful contribution boundaries exist  

All authoritative definitions, constraints, and compliance requirements are fixed **exclusively** in DOI-registered canonical records referenced below.

---

## What is being measured (high-level framing)

The Sal-Meter project targets the **objective, reproducible measurement of consciousness-like signals**.

These signals are defined as **experimentally observable correlates of mental state dynamics**,  
derived from biological and physical processes.

> This system does **not** claim to measure subjective experience itself.

Instead, it measures structured signal patterns that correlate with internal state transitions.

### Canonical output indices
CFE⁺ addresses a structural gap in existing consciousness research by
organizing consciousness along three fundamental information–energy axes:

- **OE (Ordered Energy)**: structured, coherent informational energy
- **EE (Entropic Energy)**: dissipative, destabilizing, and disordering energy
- **RE (Relational Energy)**: connective, resonant, and synchronizing energy

From this architecture, the framework defines three **canonical indices**:

1. **VCE (Vibrational Consciousness Energy)**  
   An index representing individual-level consciousness alignment
   and internal dynamical patterns

2. **CRI (Consciousness Resonance Index)**  
   An index measuring relational coherence, synchronization,
   and resonance across interpersonal and group-level systems

3. **CFI (Conscious Field Index)**  
   An index representing large-scale social and civilizational
   consciousness field coherence and structural integration

This repository **does not redefine** the mathematical formulations,
thresholds, or normative meanings of these indices.

All authoritative definitions reside exclusively in
**DOI-registered canonical documents**.
This document explains only the **conceptual and architectural flow**.

## Measurement principle (CAIS Layer-0)

At the core of CAIS (Consciousness–Aptamer Interface System) lies a  
**biochemical-to-signal transduction layer**.

### Core elements
- Aptamer–iodine **multi-oxidation state sensing**  
- Redox state dynamics, including **GSH / GSSG coupling**  
- Time-resolved signal extraction  
- Non-subjective, sensor-derived data only  

Biochemical state transitions are converted into **stable, analyzable signal streams**  
suitable for computational processing and validation.

---

## System abstraction (non-exhaustive)

A CAIS-compatible Sal-Meter system can be abstracted into **five layers**:

1. **Biochemical interface**  
   Aptamer–iodine sensing and redox interaction

2. **Signal acquisition**  
   Electrochemical, optical, or hybrid sensing pathways

3. **Signal processing**  
   Noise reduction, normalization, temporal feature extraction

4. **Index computation**  
   Mapping signals to VCE / CRI / CFI

5. **Validation interface**  
   Reproducibility checks and readiness for independent assessment

> Teams may contribute to **any single layer**.  
> Full-stack implementation is **not required**.

---

## What counts as a valid technical contribution

Valid contributions include (but are not limited to):

- Sensor chemistry refinement or characterization  
- Signal-processing or feature-extraction algorithms  
- Hardware, firmware, or modular electronics  
- Calibration, normalization, or drift-compensation methods  
- Statistical validation or benchmarking pipelines  
- Data integrity, logging, or reproducibility tooling  

A contribution does **not** need to optimize all indices.  
**Partial, bounded improvements are explicitly acceptable.**

---

## What does NOT count (common misconceptions)

The following are **explicitly excluded**:

- EEG-only, HRV-only, or questionnaire-based systems  
- Black-box “consciousness scores” without CAIS index mapping  
- Self-validated systems without independent verification readiness  
- Closed designs blocking inspection of core mechanisms  

These exclusions are formally defined in the **Sal-Meter Negative Definition** (canonical DOI).

---

## Validation expectations (competition phase)

During the Open Competition phase:

- Systems are **research-only**  
- No medical, diagnostic, or therapeutic claims are permitted  
- Performance targets are **statistical**, not clinical  

Minimum expectations include:

- Reproducibility across sessions and conditions  
- Sensitivity and specificity benchmarks (defined canonically)  
- Structural readiness for **independent CRO validation** (Phase 3)

## Suggested next step
If this technical framing appears compatible with your work:

1. Review the DOI-registered CAIS documents  
2. Identify **one layer** aligned with your existing research  
3. Evaluate whether a **3–6 month exploratory contribution** is feasible  

No application, registration, or declaration is required to begin internal exploration.
