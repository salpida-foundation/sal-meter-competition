## Competition Overview

The Sal-Meter Open Competition is a non-exclusive, structurally open, and monopoly-resistant framework for developing the **Sal-Meter** — a CAIS-compliant device that measures consciousness states via aptamer-iodine redox sensing.

### Three Competition Tracks

| Track | Scope | Funding | Teams | Duration |
|-------|-------|---------|-------|----------|
| **Track A** | Full Sal-Meter system | $300,000 USD per team | 2-3 selected | 9 months development + 6 months validation |
| **Track B** | Component development | $50,000-$100,000 USD per team | 5-10 selected | 6-12 months |
| **Track C** | Open community | No funding | Unlimited | Ongoing |

## Four Canonical Documents (Mandatory Reading)

All teams MUST comply with these four non-derogable canonical documents:

### 1. Sal-Meter Canonical Definition v1.0
**What IS a Sal-Meter**

https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18452075

- Defines Sal-Meter as CAIS-compliant device measuring OE, RE, EE via aptamer-iodine sensing
- Outputs VCE, CRI, CFI indices (0-1.0 normalized)
- No alternative or proprietary definitions permitted

### 2. CAIS Compliance Boundary v1.0
**Mandatory Technical Constraints**

https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18452269

- CAIS Layer-0: Iodine multi-oxidation sensing (I⁻ → I₂ → I₃⁻ → I₅⁻)
- GSH/GSSG redox ratio detection
- OE/RE/EE framework operation
- VCE/CRI/CFI output with timestamps

### 3. Sal-Meter Open Competition Charter v1.0
**Competition Governance & Rules**

https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18452453

- Track A/B/C structures and evaluation criteria
- Anti-capture and anti-monopolization safeguards
- CRO validation requirements (n≥30, sensitivity≥80%, specificity≥85%)
- Mandatory CC BY-SA 4.0 for core design
- Temporal non-drift protections

### 4. Sal-Meter Negative Definition v1.0
**What is NOT a Sal-Meter (Anti-Misuse)**

https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18452694

- Excludes HRV trackers, EEG headsets, meditation monitors without aptamer-iodine sensing
- Excludes devices outputting non-CAIS or proprietary indices
- Excludes unvalidated or closed-source systems

## Core Principles

- **Non-Exclusive**: No single team or institution can monopolize Sal-Meter development
- **Open Core Design**: Aptamer-iodine architecture, CAIS API, VCE/CRI/CFI computation must remain open (CC BY-SA 4.0)
- **Independent Validation**: CRO validation mandatory, SICS does not certify — only interprets canonical documents
- **Anti-Capture**: Temporal non-drift protections prevent erosion of openness over time

---

## Evaluation Criteria

**Track A & B teams evaluated on:**

- **CAIS Compliance** — 25%
- **Technical Performance** — 40% (sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility)
- **Innovation** — 20% (novelty within CAIS boundaries, scalability)
- **Open-Source Contribution** — 10% (documentation quality, reproducibility)
- **CCF Alignment** — 5%

**Minimum Requirements:**
- n ≥ 30 validation cohort
- Sensitivity ≥ 80%
- Specificity ≥ 85%
- Independent CRO validation

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use my own biosensor platform?**  
A: Yes, as long as it satisfies CAIS Layer-0 requirements (aptamer-iodine multi-oxidation sensing, GSH/GSSG detection).

**Q: Can I patent my implementation?**  
A: Implementation-specific IP may be retained, but core Sal-Meter design (aptamer-iodine architecture, CAIS API, VCE/CRI/CFI algorithms) must remain open (CC BY-SA 4.0).

**Q: What if I'm not a hardware team?**  
A: Track B includes component development (sensor modules, signal processing, algorithms, cartridge systems). Track C is open to all.

**Q: Is this a one-time competition?**  
A: No. The Open Competition Charter includes temporal non-drift protections. This framework is permanent and monopoly-resistant by design.

**Q: Who validates compliance?**  
A: Independent CRO validates performance. SICS interprets canonical documents but does not certify teams.
