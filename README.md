## PI Quick Decision Pack (2 pages)

If you are a principal investigator or lab lead considering whether this competition
is worth internal discussion, please start here:

- **PI Quick Decision Pack — Go / No-Go Brief (Figshare PDF)**  
  https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.31287268

- **Non-canonical markdown mirror in this repository**  
  https://github.com/salpida-foundation/sal-meter-competition/blob/main/docs/PI_Quick_Decision_Pack.md

This document is written in the second person for PIs and is intended for rapid
internal evaluation. It may be forwarded directly to co-PIs, students, or collaborators
for preliminary discussion.

## Canonical Documents (Mandatory)

All participants must comply with the following four DOI-registered documents.
These define the non-derogable technical and governance boundaries.

| # | Document | DOI |
|---|---------|-----|
| 1 | Sal-Meter Canonical Definition v1.0 | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18452075 |
| 2 | CAIS Compliance Boundary v1.0 | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18452269 |
| 3 | Sal-Meter Open Competition Charter v1.0 | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18452453 |
| 4 | Sal-Meter Negative Definition v1.0 | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18452694 |

Failure to comply with these documents results in automatic disqualification.

## Research Scope and Limitations

This competition is strictly for **research and validation**.

- Not a medical device
- No clinical or diagnostic claims
- No therapeutic claims
- Measurement targets consciousness-like signals only
- Later phases require independent third-party validation prior to any regulatory pathway

---

## Participation Tracks

### Track A — Full System Development
- Integrated Sal-Meter prototype
- Suitable for established, multidisciplinary teams
- Research support provided in milestone-based tranches
- Intended to partially offset real development costs, not to fully fund them

### Track B — Modular / Component Development
- Focused contributions (algorithms, hardware modules, software layers)
- Parallel experimentation encouraged
- Milestone-based research support aligned with deliverables

### Track C — Open Community
- Open participation, no direct funding
- Contributions include code, documentation, experiments, analysis, or replication
- Recognition, citation, and community visibility

---

## Research Support Model

- Support is provided **only upon milestone completion**
- No lump-sum or upfront funding
- Structure is designed to:
  - Enable meaningful research progress
  - Filter for teams with genuine commitment and capacity
  - Avoid speculative or low-effort participation

Specific financial details are intentionally abstracted at this stage.
See the Technical & Governance Snapshot for structural context.

## Development Phases

| Phase | Focus |
