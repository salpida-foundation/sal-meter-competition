# Sal-Meter Open Competition

Open global research competition to develop **objective consciousness-like signal
measurement systems** under the CAIS (Consciousness–Aptamer Interface System) standard.

This repository is a **non-authoritative operational index**.
All canonical definitions, governance rules, and authority are fixed exclusively in
**DOI-registered documents**.

---

## Before You Read Further

This is **not** a startup accelerator.  
This is **not** a product or commercialization program.  
This is **not** a medical or clinical device pathway.

This competition exists to test whether **consciousness-like signals can be measured
objectively**, reproducibly, and openly — and to fix those standards permanently.

If you are looking for funding, certification, endorsement, or clinical approval,
you should stop here.

---

## Start Here: PI-Level Go / No-Go (30 minutes)

If you are a **Principal Investigator or lab lead**, begin with the following document:

- **PI Quick Decision Pack — Go / No-Go Brief (Figshare, 2 pages)**  
  https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.31287268

This document enables a PI-level **go / no-go decision within 30 minutes** and may be
forwarded internally without modification.

A non-canonical markdown mirror is available here:
- docs/PI_Quick_Decision_Pack.md

## Core Entry Documents (Figshare)

The following **five documents** constitute the **entry layer** for this competition.
They provide orientation, system context, and technical entry points.

   Scope fit, risk posture, and internal decision checklist for PIs.  
   https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.31287268

2. **Sal-Meter System Overview v1.0**  
   Device concept, indices (OE/EE/RE), and measurement logic at system level.  
   https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.31275067

3. **Sal-Meter Open Competition — Technical & Governance Snapshot v2.0**

4. **CAIS Architecture & Sal-Meter Technical Snapshot v1.0**  
   System-level architecture, hardware boundaries, signal pathways, and integration
   constraints required for reproducible CAIS-compliant implementations.  
   https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.31287529

5. **CAIS Aptamer G-Iodine — Minimal Kernel Diagram v1.0**  
   Visual specification of the Layer-0 molecular kernel that gates signals prior to
   interpretation, indexing, or inference.  
   https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.31287763

This repository provides working markdown mirrors, discussions, and coordination only.
**Canonical authority does not reside here.**

## Minimal Kernel (M0) — Aptamer G-Iodine

The **Minimal Kernel (M0)** defines the CAIS **Layer-0** boundary:
a molecular signal-gating interface that operates **prior to any interpretation,
indexing, or inference**.

The M0 kernel is **conceptually upstream of all CAIS-compliant implementations** and
should be understood before attempting **Track A** or **Track B** development.

It is not an application, device, or interpretation layer.
It exists solely as a **non-therapeutic signal interface** between biochemical state
and measurable CAIS signals.

## What This Competition Is

- An **international open research competition**
- Focused on **research-grade, pre-regulatory systems**
- Designed around **objective measurement of consciousness-like signals**
- Governed by **fixed, non-drifting standards** defined in advance
- Structured so that **partial, modular contributions are valid outcomes**

---

## What This Competition Is Not

- Not a venture or startup program  
- Not a medical device or diagnostic project  
- Not a commercialization or licensing pathway  
- Not a closed or proprietary platform  
- Not a certification or endorsement scheme  

---

## Participation Tracks (Self-Selection)

### Track A — Full System Development

For teams capable of delivering a complete, validated system.

If you are unsure whether your team qualifies for Track A, **you probably do not**.

- Multi-disciplinary, senior-led teams
- Full CAIS stack coverage required
- Independent validation required
- Milestone-based research support
- High risk, high rigor

---

### Track B — Component Development

For teams contributing **clearly bounded subsystems**, including:

- Signal processing algorithms  
- AI / inference models  
- Firmware or embedded control  
- Mobile / cloud interfaces  
- Validation tooling  

Depth over breadth is prioritized.

---

### Track C — Open Community (Default Entry)

For exploratory or first-time contributors.

- Individuals or small teams
- No funding dependency
- Self-paced, modular contributions
- Papers, prototypes, documentation, or code

Escalation to Track B or A is optional and evidence-driven.

---

## Canonical Authority (Mandatory)

All participants must comply with the following **four DOI-registered canonical documents**.
These override any interpretation derived from this repository or from Figshare entry materials.

| # | Document | DOI |
|---|---------|-----|
| 1 | Sal-Meter Canonical Definition v1.0 | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18452075 |
| 2 | CAIS Compliance Boundary v1.0 | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18452269 |
| 3 | Sal-Meter Open Competition Charter v1.0 | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18452453 |
| 4 | Sal-Meter Negative Definition v1.0 | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18452694 |

Failure to read and comply results in **automatic disqualification**.

---

## Research Scope and Medical Claims

This competition is strictly **research-only**.

- No medical or clinical claims  
- No diagnostic or therapeutic use  
- No regulatory submission in scope  

Any downstream pathway requires **independent redesign, validation, and regulatory review**.

---

## Governance and the Role of SICS

The Salpida Institute of Consciousness Science (SICS):

- Interprets canonical documents
- Maintains governance consistency
- Resolves rule-interpretation disputes

SICS does **not** score teams, rank outcomes, certify devices, endorse products,
or approve commercialization.

---
