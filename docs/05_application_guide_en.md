# Application Guide: How to Participate in the Sal-Meter Open Competition

---

## About This Document (Please Read First)

This document is a **practical application guide** for teams and individuals  
who have **already decided to explore participation** in the Sal-Meter Open Competition.

- This is **not** a document for deciding whether to participate.
- It explains **how to prepare and how to submit**, not whether you qualify.
- This document is **non-canonical** and defines **no authority, standards, or rights**.

All technical, legal, and interpretive authority resides **exclusively** in the  
DOI-registered Canonical documents listed below.

## The Nature of This Competition

The Sal-Meter Open Competition is **not a winner-takes-all contest**.

It is designed to:

- Prevent premature standard monopolization
- Avoid single-path interpretation lock-in
- Enable multiple independent approaches to be tested in parallel

Participation outcomes are considered meaningful even if they result in:

- Partial validation or limitation discovery
- Negative or null results with clear documentation
- Foundational data for future research
- Transferable insight for other teams or future phases

This is a **research participation framework**, not a ranking exercise.

---

## Overall Participation Flow

Participation typically follows **three broad stages**:

1. **Pre-Application Understanding**  
   Reading canonical documents and internal discussion

2. **Lightweight Application Package**  
   A declaration of how you intend to contribute

3. **Submission & Review**  
   Review conducted with sufficient time and no speed pressure

There is **no fixed competition tempo**.

---

## Stage 1: Pre-Application Understanding

### 1-1. Canonical Document Familiarity

All teams should be aligned on the following principles:

- Sal-Meter is **not** a therapeutic or diagnostic device
- Layer 0 is a **non-therapeutic signal interface**
- VCE / CRI / CFI indices are defined strictly by CAIS
- Interpretive authority lies in Canonical definitions, not individual teams

This applies equally to Track A, B, and C.  
Only the depth of engagement differs.

---

## Stage 2: Preparing the Application Package

### Core Design Principles (Important)

- **Perfection is not required**
- **Full technical disclosure is not required**
- **Early-stage or exploratory ideas are welcome**
- It is acceptable to state:
  “We are strong in this area and seek collaboration in others.”

This competition is closer to **research partner discovery**  
than to a conventional selection exam.

---

### A) Team Overview (Approx. 1 Page)

Suggested elements:

- Team name (working name acceptable)
- Approximate team size (e.g., 1–3, 3–6, etc.)
- Intended track(s): A / B / C (multiple allowed)
- Brief description of intended contribution

Example statements:

> We have strong experience in signal processing,  
> but are seeking collaboration on molecular interfaces.

> We aim to reinterpret an existing sensor approach within CAIS constraints.

---

### B) Team Member Summary (Lightweight)

For each member, brief information is sufficient:

- Name or identifier
- Intended role (e.g., signal processing, hardware, experiment design)
- 2–3 lines of relevant experience

No fixed career-length or credential thresholds apply.

---

### C) Technical Concept (Optional, Recommended 1–2 Pages)

A **directional proposal** is sufficient.

Possible elements:

- CAIS layer(s) you wish to explore
- Hypothesis or technical approach
- Anticipated challenges
- Current status (idea / pilot / existing work)

For Track A or B teams,  
more detail may support deeper follow-up discussions,  
but it is **not mandatory**.

---

### D) Research Support & Funding (Clarification)

This program is **not structured as full-cost research funding**.

Support may take forms such as:

- Initial participation support
- Milestone-based evaluation and follow-up support
- Exceptional-case support for uniquely valuable contributions

Key principles:

- Support conditions may differ by team and phase
- Funding details are **not disclosed between teams**
- This is **not a prize-based competition**

---

## Stage 3: Submission

### How to Submit

Please submit by email.

---

### Review & Response

- Review may take **adequate time** depending on submission volume
- Teams are reviewed comparatively, not sequentially
- Immediate responses are not assumed or expected

This pacing is **intentional**,  
to avoid artificial pressure on both participants and organizers.

---

## Frequently Asked (Brief)

**Q. Is there a penalty for failure or negative results?**  
A. No. Clearly documented negative results are considered valuable contributions.

**Q. How is idea confidentiality handled?**  
A. Submit only what you are comfortable sharing. Minimal disclosure is acceptable.

**Q. Can individuals or very small teams participate?**  
A. Yes. This applies to Track C and may also apply to Track A/B.
