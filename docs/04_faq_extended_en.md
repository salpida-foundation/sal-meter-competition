# Frequently Asked Questions (Extended FAQ)

This document addresses common questions about the Sal-Meter Open Competition.  
It is intentionally written to clarify **who should participate — and who should not**.

If any answer below creates hesitation, negotiation intent, or discomfort,  
**Track C is the appropriate default entry point.**

---

## 1. Governance, Judging, and the Role of SICS

### Q1. Who selects the judges?

**A.**  
Judges are constituted by **SICS (Salpida Institute of Consciousness Science)** and consist of **7–9 independent external experts** drawn from:

- Biosensors  
- Aptamer science  
- AI and machine learning  
- Statistics and validation science  
- Systems and hardware engineering  
- Ethics and governance  

**Mandatory independence conditions:**

- No financial interest in participating teams  
- No institutional affiliation with participating organizations during the competition  
- **SICS personnel are categorically excluded from technical judging**

This structure is fixed and non-negotiable.

---

### Q2. What exactly is SICS’s role?

**A.**  
SICS acts as a **constitutional and interpretive authority only**.

**SICS does:**

- Interpret canonical documents (CAIS, Sal-Meter definitions)  
- Resolve disputes regarding rule interpretation  
- Prevent reinterpretation drift of standards  

**SICS does not:**

- Score teams  
- Rank prototypes  
- Approve or reject technical approaches  
- Allocate funding  
- Influence evaluation outcomes  

In short: **SICS defines the rules. Others evaluate compliance.**

---

### Q3. Can SICS influence results indirectly?

**A.**  
No. The competition is explicitly designed to prevent this.

Structural safeguards include:

1. **Separation of authority**  
   - Interpretation (SICS) and evaluation (judges) are institutionally separated  

2. **Conflict-of-interest exclusion**  
   - Any judge with financial or institutional overlap is excluded  

3. **Open traceability**  
   - Validation logic and results are published openly  

4. **Strict dispute limits**  
   - Only rule interpretation may be reviewed  
   - Scores and rankings are final  

If this governance model is unacceptable, **do not apply beyond Track C**.

---

## 2. Validation, CROs, and Medical Scope

### Q4. Who performs final validation?

**A.**  
Final validation is conducted by an **independent Contract Research Organization (CRO)**.

The CRO:

- Executes predefined validation protocols  
- Reports raw and processed measurement data  

The CRO does **not**:

- Redefine CAIS metrics  
- Interpret results philosophically  
- Certify, approve, or endorse devices  

All interpretive authority remains fixed in **DOI-registered canonical documents**.

---

### Q5. Is this clinical or medical validation?

**A.**  
No. Explicitly not.

- This is **research-grade validation only**  
- No diagnostic, therapeutic, or clinical claims are permitted  
- No regulatory pathways are involved  

If your work requires medical-device classification, regulatory clearance, or clinical endpoints, **this competition is not appropriate**.

---

## 3. Team Structure and Eligibility

### Q6. Must Track A teams have exactly seven members?

**A.**  
No. Seven members is a **reference structure**, not a quota.

What matters is **capability coverage**, not headcount:

- Biosensor / chemistry expertise  
- Signal processing and/or AI  
- Hardware or systems engineering  
- Statistical validation  
- Project coordination  

Teams lacking any of these capabilities should **not apply to Track A**.

---

### Q7. Can international or mixed-nationality teams participate?

**A.**  
Yes. There are **no nationality or residency restrictions**.

International and multi-institutional teams are encouraged, provided coordination is realistic.

---

### Q8. Can students participate?

**A.**  
Yes — with clear role boundaries.

- **Track A / B:**  
  - Senior researchers must lead  
  - Students participate in scoped or supporting roles  

- **Track C:**  
  - Open to students, individuals, and exploratory contributors  

For most students, **Track C is the correct entry point**.

---

## 4. Funding, Costs, and Financial Misunderstandings

### Q9. Does the competition funding cover full research costs?

**A.**  
No.

Any funding associated with this competition is **milestone-based research support**, not project underwriting.

It is designed to:

- Enable bounded progress  
- Reward validated completion  

It is **not** intended to fully fund labs, salaries, or institutional programs.

If full cost coverage is required, **do not apply beyond Track C**.

---

### Q10. Why is full funding intentionally avoided?

**A.**  
Because the goal is **standard formation and signal validity**, not institutional dependency.

This structure:

- Filters for serious, self-committed teams  
- Discourages speculative or symbolic participation  
- Reduces risk of abandoned or low-effort projects  

This is **a deliberate filter**, not a limitation.

---

## 5. IP, Patents, and Boundary Conditions

### Q11. Can teams file patents?

**A.**  
Yes — **within strict boundaries**.

- Core standards (CAIS, Sal-Meter definitions, indices) remain **open** under CC BY-SA  
- Implementation-specific innovations may be published or protected independently  
- Canonical definitions cannot be enclosed, redefined, or restricted  

There is **no retroactive negotiation** of these boundaries.

If this is a concern, **Track C is recommended**.

---

## 6. Certification, Endorsement, and Common Misinterpretations

### Q12. Does SICS certify, approve, or endorse teams or devices?

**A.**  
No.

SICS:

- Does not certify devices  
- Does not endorse products  
- Does not provide regulatory approval  
- Does not issue commercial validation  

Participation represents **research contribution only**.

---

### Q13. Is this a medical-device or commercialization pathway?

**A.**  
No.

This competition operates **strictly upstream of regulation and commercialization**.

Any downstream pathway requires:

- Independent redesign  
- Independent validation  
- Independent regulatory submission  

No shortcut or implied approval exists.

---

## 7. When This Competition Is Not a Good Fit

Participation is **not recommended** if:

- Immediate commercialization is required  
- Clinical claims are essential  
- Closed or proprietary standards are preferred  
- Short-term certainty is mandatory  

This competition favors **exploratory rigor over guaranteed outcomes**.

---

## 8. Bottom-Line Guidance

If your team can commit to a **bounded, modular research effort** within fixed open standards, participation is appropriate.

If governance constraints, funding limits, or uncertainty are problematic,  
**Track C is the rational default**.

Progression to Track B or Track A is optional and evidence-driven.
