## What this document is
This document explains **why** the Sal-Meter Open Competition exists.

It frames Sal-Meter not as “just a device”, but as a **civilizational experiment**:
- Can consciousness function as a measurable standard?
- Can open governance precede technology?
- Can philosophy survive contact with implementation?

## What this document is NOT
This document does **not** redefine any standard.

All authority remains fixed exclusively in the **4 Canonical DOI documents**:
1) Sal-Meter Canonical Definition v1.0  
2) CAIS Compliance Boundary v1.0  
3) Sal-Meter Open Competition Charter v1.0  
4) Sal-Meter Negative Definition v1.0  

If any statement here conflicts with canonical DOI records, **canonical DOI records override**.

## Quick extract (what it asserts)
- CAIS Layer-0 requires iodine redox multi-oxidation sensing: I⁻ → I₂ → I₃⁻ → I₅⁻
- CAIS Layer-1 requires canonical outputs: VCE / CRI / CFI (0–1.0, timestamped)
- CRO validation is the safeguard (independent, public, reproducible)
- Anti-capture governance is the point: no single entity may monopolize consciousness measurement
