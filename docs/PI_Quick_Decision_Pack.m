# PI Quick Decision Pack  
## Sal-Meter Open Competition — Go / No-Go Brief for Principal Investigators

This document is designed to be sufficient for a PI-level go/no-go decision within 30 minutes, without additional preparation, document synthesis, or internal re-framing.

---

## What this competition is

- An international open scientific competition to build **objective consciousness-measurement systems** based on the CAIS (Consciousness–Aptamer Interface System) standard.
- A **research-grade, pre-regulatory program** focused on sensor validation, signal processing, and system architecture.
- A framework where **governance, authorship, and IP boundaries are fixed upfront** via DOI-registered canonical documents.

---

## What this competition is not

- Not a startup accelerator.
- Not a venture or commercialization program.
- Not a proprietary or closed platform.
- Not a clinical or medical-claim project.

---

## Governance and IP in one glance

- Canonical definitions and compliance rules are fixed via DOI-registered records.
- Core standards remain open (CC BY-SA 4.0).
- Implementation-specific work may be published and credited independently.
- No retroactive IP ambiguity or governance drift.

## Risk–Reward snapshot

| Dimension | Assessment |
|---------|------------|
| Scientific novelty | High |
| Time commitment | Modular and bounded |
| Career upside | Publications, standard authorship, visible contribution |
| Reputational downside | Low (research-only, no clinical claims) |
| IP risk | Low (boundaries defined upfront) |

---

## Minimum viable participation (Track C)

- Team size: 1 PhD or Postdoc + optional MSc/Engineer
- Time scale: 3–6 months exploratory effort
- Scope: One clearly bounded module aligned with existing lab strengths
- No requirement to commit to full system development

Track C is the primary low-risk entry pathway.  
Escalation to Track B or Track A remains optional and data-driven.

---

## Expected academic outcomes

Depending on scope and contribution:

- Methodology or prototype papers
- Sensor, signal-processing, or system-architecture publications
- Preprints or workshop papers related to consciousness-measurement interfaces
- Explicit linkage to CAIS / CCF canonical standards for citation and attribution

Participation can be listed as:  
“Sal-Meter CAIS Open Competition — Research Team Member”

---

## If the project does not progress, what remains

- Validated or partially validated sensor or signal pipelines
- Reusable experimental protocols and datasets
- New exploratory research directions compatible with future grants
- Publishable negative or boundary-finding results

Participation is structured as a **learning-positive project**, not a zero-sum bet.

---

## Early participation and isolation risk

Early participation does not imply isolation.

- Multiple independent teams are reviewing or exploring participation paths.
- No team is expected to develop the full CAIS stack alone.
- Contributions are explicitly modular by design.

---

## When not to participate

Participation is not recommended if:

- No modular effort can be allocated.
- Immediate clinical translation is required.
- Fixed open standards are unacceptable.
- Only short-term, low-uncertainty projects are preferred.

---

## Bottom-line decision rule

If your lab is interested in objective measurement of mental or consciousness-related states, and can allocate a small, modular exploratory effort, Track C participation is a rational default.

Escalation remains optional.

---

## Suggested next step if the answer is “maybe”

1. Read `docs/01_technical_details.md` (approximately 15 minutes).
2. Identify one module aligned with your lab’s strongest existing capability.
3. Decide internally whether a Track C exploratory contribution is feasible.

No further commitment is required at this stage.
