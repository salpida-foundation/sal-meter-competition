## For Principal Investigators (30-minute filter)

If you need to decide quickly whether this competition fits your lab,
do **not** start with the full documentation.

Begin here:

- **[PI Quick Decision Pack (2 pages)](docs/PI_Quick_Decision_Pack.md)**  
- Designed for a PI-level **go / no-go decision within 30 minutes**
- If the answer is “maybe”, it can be shared directly in a lab meeting as-is

If this document does not clearly fit your research structure,  
**Track C is the rational default — or do not proceed.**

# Sal-Meter Competition — Documentation Index

This folder contains **non-canonical explanatory materials**.

They clarify intent, structure, and participation mechanics —  
they do **not** define what a Sal-Meter is.

### Recommended reading order (self-filtering sequence)

1. **00_philosophy_foundation.md**  
   Why this competition exists — and why it avoids guarantees

2. **01_technical_details.md**  
   System-level architecture and measurement logic (non-authoritative)

3. **02_phase_roadmap_en.md**  
   Phase structure and pass/fail progression (no promises, no timelines guarantees)

4. **03_team_composition.md**  
   Who is realistically capable of each track — and who is not

5. **04_faq_extended_en.md**  
   Common misunderstandings, clarified early to prevent misalignment

6. **05_application_guide_en.md**  
   How to apply *after* self-qualification is complete

## Canonical Authority (Non-Negotiable)

All standards, definitions, and compliance boundaries are fixed in
**DOI-registered canonical records only**.

If any document in this folder appears to conflict with a canonical record,
**the canonical record always prevails**.

Canonical index:
https://github.com/salpida-foundation/salpida-canonical

If you are comfortable with uncertainty, fixed rules, and open outcomes,
begin with Track C.

If you require certainty, endorsement, or institutional guarantees,
this competition is not a suitable fit.
