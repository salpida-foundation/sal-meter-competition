## Critical: 4 Canonical Documents (Constitution)

All participants must comply with these 4 DOI-registered documents. These are the legal/technical foundation.

| # | Document | DOI | Content |
|---|----------|-----|---------|
| 1 | **Sal-Meter Canonical Definition v1.0** | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18452075 | What IS a Sal-Meter: definition, sensor tech, indices |
| 2 | **CAIS Compliance Boundary v1.0** | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18452269 | Mandatory requirements; violation = disqualification |
| 3 | **Competition Charter v1.0** | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18452453 | Rules, judging criteria, IP policy, governance |
| 4 | **Negative Definition v1.0** | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18452694 | What is NOT a Sal-Meter (anti-misuse) |

**⚠️ Critical:** Failure to read and comply with these 4 documents will result in automatic disqualification.

## Important Notice: Research Purpose and Medical Claims Limitation

This competition is for **research and validation purposes only.**

**Current Phase (Phase 2):** 
- NOT a medical device (research use only)
- NO medical efficacy claims
- Suicide risk prediction: long-term research goal, but NO clinical claims at this stage
- Phase 3-4: Independent validation before regulatory submission

---

## What Is This Competition?

### Problem Definition

Current mental health relies heavily on subjective assessment (questionnaires, clinician judgment):
- Diagnostic criteria vary across practitioners
- Lack of objective data makes treatment tracking difficult
- AI cannot understand human consciousness without objective metrics

### Our Approach

Using scientific standards (CAIS technology), measure consciousness states objectively and publish all results openly (CC BY-SA 4.0).

### Core Technology

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Sensor** | Aptamer + Iodine oxidation state detection |
| **Measurement** | Results in <1 minute (VCE, CRI, CFI indices) |
| **Validation** | Independent CRO validation planned |
| **License** | CC BY-SA 4.0 (core design must remain open) |

---

## Three Participation Tracks

### Track A: Full System Development (Most Challenging)

- **Prize:** $300,000 USD per team
- **Teams Selected:** 2-3
- **Duration:** 9 months development + 6 months validation = 15 months
- **Recruitment Starts:** April 2026

#### Prize vs. Research Funding (Critical Distinction)

⚠️ **Important:** Clear separation

| Category | Amount | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Prize (SICS)** | $300,000 | Completion compensation |
| **Total Development Cost** | ~$900,000 | Team must secure separately |

**Example:**
- Estimated personnel costs: $630,000 (9 months)
- Other costs (parts, lab, travel): $270,000
- **Total needed:** $900,000
- **Prize covers:** 33% only

**This Means:**
- The $300K is a reward, NOT the full development budget
- Teams must independently source additional funding from:
  - University research budgets
  - Corporate R&D budgets
  - External grants and fellowships
  - Self-funded resources

#### Required Team Composition

**7 core members + advisory board**

| Role | Count | Experience | Monthly Salary (USD reference) |
|------|-------|------------|------------------------------|
| Biosensor/Chemistry PhD | 2 | 2-3+ years | $8,000-$12,000 |
| Signal Processing/AI Engineer | 2-3 | 2-3+ years | $6,000-$10,000 |
| Hardware Engineer | 1 | 2+ years | $6,000-$10,000 |
| Statistics/Validation Specialist | 1 | 2+ years | $6,000-$8,000 |
| Project Manager | 1 | 3+ years | $7,000-$9,000 |

**Note:** Salary ranges are USD reference only. Each team sets its own budget.

## Core Principles

- **Non-Exclusive:** No single team/institution can monopolize Sal-Meter
- **Open Core Design:** Aptamer-iodine architecture, CAIS API, VCE/CRI/CFI algorithms must remain open (CC BY-SA 4.0)
- **Independent Validation:** CRO validates; SICS only interprets canonical documents
- **Anti-Capture:** Temporal non-drift protections prevent erosion of openness

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I use my own biosensor platform?

**A:** Yes, as long as it satisfies CAIS Layer-0 requirements (aptamer-iodine multi-oxidation sensing, GSH/GSSG detection).

### Q: Can I patent my implementation?

**A:** Implementation-specific IP may be retained, but core Sal-Meter design (aptamer-iodine architecture, CAIS API, VCE/CRI/CFI algorithms) must remain open (CC BY-SA 4.0).

### Q: What if I'm not a hardware team?

**A:** Track B includes component development. Track C is open to all.

### Q: Is this a one-time competition?

**A:** No. The Charter includes temporal non-drift protections. This framework is permanent and monopoly-resistant by design.

### Q: Who validates compliance?

**A:** Independent CRO validates performance. SICS interprets canonical documents but does not certify teams.

### Q: Can international teams apply?

**A:** Yes. No citizenship or residency restrictions. English communication required.

### Q: Do I need experience to participate?

**A:** 
- **Track C:** No experience required
- **Track A/B:** 2-3+ years relevant experience recommended
