# Expected Reactions from PIs and Researchers  
## Will They Participate? A Realistic Forecast

This section provides a **clear, unsentimental forecast** of how principal investigators (PIs), senior researchers, and labs are likely to react to the Sal-Meter Open Competition and its accompanying documents.

The goal is not promotion, but **prediction**.

---

## 1. First Impression (Initial 10-Second Reaction)

The most common immediate reaction will be:

> “This is unusual… but it doesn’t feel superficial.”

- It does not resemble a typical medical device program  
- It is not a startup accelerator  
- It is not merely a philosophical initiative  

Instead, it is perceived as **non-standard, but structurally serious**.

This matters.  
Projects that feel “strange but rigorous” attract exploratory researchers.

---

## 2. Reactions by Researcher Type

### A. Experimental PIs (Biosensors, Signals, Chemistry, Systems)

**Likely reaction**
- “No IRB or medical device approval burden — that’s attractive”
- “No requirement for a finished product is a relief”
- “If partial CAIS implementation counts, we can participate”

**Internal reasoning**
- “I could assign one PhD student or postdoc to explore this”
- “Even failure wouldn’t be wasted effort”

**Forecast**
- **High participation likelihood**
- Especially via Track B and Track C
- This is the core contributor group

---

### B. Consciousness, Theory, and Interdisciplinary Researchers

**Likely reaction**
- “This finally connects theory to measurable structure”
- “No forced publication requirement is refreshing”

**Internal reasoning**
- “If this works, it becomes historically significant”
- “Even failure is meaningful if it’s formally recorded”

**Forecast**
- Moderate participation volume
- Strong conceptual, documentation, and discourse contribution
- Primarily Track C

---

### C. Clinical / Medical-Device-Focused PIs

**Likely reaction**
- “If it’s not a medical device, is it impactful?”
- “No IRB is good, but where does this lead?”

**Internal reasoning**
- “Does this convert into an approval pathway later?”
- “This doesn’t directly match our current KPIs”

**Forecast**
- Low early participation
- Potential interest after independent validation phases
- This is expected and acceptable

This group is **not the intended early audience**.

---

### D. AI, Data Science, and Systems Researchers

**Likely reaction**
- “The signal definitions are unusually clear”
- “No performance arms race — that’s good”
- “Emphasis on consistency over optimization builds trust”

**Internal reasoning**
- “Benchmark fatigue is real — this feels different”
- “This can be real research even without a paper”

**Forecast**
- Selective but high-quality participation
- Track B and supporting Track A roles

---

## 3. Anticipated Concerns — and What Actually Happens

### “It’s not a medical device, so it has no value”

Some will say this.  
Most experimental PIs will **not**.

Why:
- The documents clearly position this as a **pre-clinical measurement language**
- Researchers understand that clinical systems require foundational measurement layers first

Common reframing:
> “It’s valuable precisely because it’s not constrained yet.”

---

### “This feels like a waste of time”

Unlikely, given the current structure.

Time-wasting projects usually:
- Demand high compliance
- Enforce rigid outcomes
- Penalize failure

This program explicitly:
- Accepts failure
- Records negative results
- Allows partial contributions

As a result, perceived downside is low.

---

### “Who owns authorship or credit?”

This is a critical issue — and it is handled well.

Researchers understand that:
- Their results remain theirs
- Canonical documents define standards, not authorship
- Publications, if any, list the team as authors

Many will view this as:
> “A stable citation and reference anchor already exists.”

That **reduces**, rather than increases, credit anxiety.

---

## 4. The Most Important Reaction

The most meaningful response you will hear is:

> “If this works, it’s big.”

Researchers evaluate projects not only by success probability, but by **upside magnitude**.

This project offers:
- Low entry cost
- Low penalty for failure
- High conceptual upside if successful

That combination is rare.

---

## 5. Overall Assessment

### Is it worth participating?
Yes — especially for labs seeking exploratory or boundary-defining research.

### Is it meaningless because it’s not a medical device?
No — it is positioned where medical devices begin.

### Is it a waste of time?
No — failure is formally meaningful.

### Will this area grow?
Likely not as a consumer market at first, but as a **measurement and standardization domain**.

Researchers who understand this will engage.

---

## Final Summary

The dominant internal conclusion for many PIs will be:

> **“This is a safe risk.  
> Failure costs little.  
> Success changes the landscape.”**

For a research competition,  
that is a very strong position to be in.
