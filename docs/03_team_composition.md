# Team Composition Guide  
## Building a Meaningful Sal-Meter Research Team

This document is a guide for researchers and teams considering participation in the **Sal-Meter Open Competition**, explaining **which roles are needed and why those roles matter**.

This is **not** a recruitment notice.  
It does **not** assume or require a “perfect” or fully staffed team.

Sal-Meter is an **open scientific program** designed to explore an as-yet unverified question through multiple independent attempts.  
Accordingly, team composition is framed around **the minimum structure required for responsible implementation**, not around completeness or scale.

This guide is fully aligned in **tone, scope, and philosophy** with the following official reference documents:

## Core Principles

- **Not every team needs every role**
- Responsibility for even a **single CAIS layer** constitutes valid participation
- **Standards, regulation, and governance are handled by SICS**
- Participants focus on **research, implementation, and experimental attempts**
- Success, partial success, and failure are all **officially meaningful outcomes**

---

## Track A — System-Level Experimental Teams  
*(Full CAIS Stack Implementation)*

Track A is intended for teams that aim to **implement the full CAIS structure in practice**.  
The goal is not a finished product, but a **structurally coherent experimental system**.

### Recommended Team Size
- Approximately 6–8 members  
- Small, with a clear owner for each major layer

---

### 1. Molecular / Interface Specialist  
*(Layer 0 – Consciousness–Material Interface)*

This role addresses the **most fundamental question** of Sal-Meter:

- Can biological or chemical state changes  
  be transformed into **measurable signal events**?
- Can that transformation occur under **reproducible conditions**?

**Why this role matters**
- This is not a clinical or therapeutic role  
- It is responsible for whether *a signal exists at all*
- Regardless of outcome, the result itself is a scientific contribution

**Background examples**
- Aptamer research, chemical sensing, biosensors  
- Chemical biology, electrochemistry, molecular interfaces

---

### 2. Signal Processing / Data Interpretation Lead  
*(Layer 1–2 – Signal & Feature Extraction)*

This role addresses the question:

**Can state-dependent differences be separated from noise?**

- Signal stability
- Pattern differentiation across states
- Reproducibility across repeated measurements

**Why this role matters**
- This is not consciousness “interpretation”
- It tests whether **signal separation is feasible**
- Failure defines boundaries just as meaningfully as success

**Background examples**
- DSP, time-series analysis, statistical signal processing  
- Biological, physical, or experimental sensor data

---

### 3. Index / Model Engineer  
*(Layer 3 – OE / RE / EE → VCE / CRI / CFI)*

This role **does not invent new indices**.  
It implements and verifies **already-defined mappings**.

**Why this role matters**
- Not about maximizing performance metrics
- About making **limits, assumptions, and tolerances explicit**
- Emphasizes structural consistency over algorithmic competition

**Background examples**
- Machine learning, statistics, applied mathematics  
- Medical or scientific data validation

---

### 4. Hardware / Systems Integrator  
*(Layer 1 – Acquisition & Device Boundary)*

This role ensures that experiments are **physically repeatable**.

- Sensor stability
- Environmental noise control
- Consistent acquisition conditions

**Why this role matters**
- This is not product engineering
- It is **experimental environment design**
- Consistency matters more than feature completeness

---

### 5. Experiment Coordinator  
*(Internal PM / Validation Coordinator)*

This is not a managerial role.  
It exists to **maintain experimental coherence**.

- Standardizing experimental conditions
- Maintaining data logging discipline
- Preventing interpretive drift within the team

Publication, regulatory, and administrative responsibilities  
are handled by **SICS**.  
This role focuses solely on **research flow integrity**.

---

## Track B — Component & Module Teams  
*(Partial CAIS Contributions)*

Track B focuses on **well-defined parts**, not full systems.

Examples include:
- A specific signal-processing pipeline
- Variations of a molecular interface
- Firmware or data acquisition modules
- Visualization or analysis tools

### Recommended Structure
- 2–4 members
- Focused on a single technical question

**Why Track B works**
- Can connect directly to existing research
- Freely combined or compared with Track A or C
- Sufficient as an independent academic contribution

---

## Track C — Independent / Exploratory Track  
*(Self-Funded · Open Exploration · CAIS-Compliant)*

Track C provides the **highest degree of freedom** within the Sal-Meter Open Competition.  
There are **no restrictions** on team size, duration, scope, or implementation method.

The core definition of Track C is as follows:

> **Track C is an independent experimental track  
> in which participants, using their own resources and judgment,  
> freely explore and implement CAIS / Sal-Meter–aligned approaches  
> without external research funding.**

Track C does not assume completion or success.  
**Attempt, exploration, and boundary-setting themselves** are recognized as valid contributions.

---

### Core Principles of Track C

- **Self-funded**  
  No external research support required  
- **Implementation freedom**  
  No restrictions on tools, methods, or scope  
- **CAIS compliance**  
  Structural coherence precedes interpretation or claims  
- **Open outcome**  
  Results are shared regardless of success or failure

Track C is **not** a “small experiment only” track.  
It is the **broadest experimental space** in the program.

---

### Participation Spectrum (Illustrative)

All of the following are equally valid under Track C:

- A single researcher conducting theoretical or conceptual validation  
- A 2–3 person pilot experiment or prototype  
- A 4–6+ member independent research team  
- A self-funded maker or startup-style project  
- Re-analysis or critical testing of existing work under CAIS constraints  

The example below is provided only to illustrate **minimum entry**, not to define limits.

> *Minimal entry example (non-binding):*  
> - Team: 1–2 people  
> - Duration: approximately 3–6 months  
> - Scope: a single module, experiment, or concept test  

This example shows how *little* is required to begin.  
Larger, longer, or more ambitious efforts are **explicitly included**.

---

### Purpose of Track C

Track C exists to:

- Rapidly test unverified or unconventional approaches  
- Accommodate ideas not pursued in Track A or B  
- Officially record **negative or null results**  
- Clarify the extensibility and limits of CAIS structures  

Track C is not the track most likely to “win.”  
It is the track most likely to **teach the field something new**.

---

### Role Separation: Track C and SICS

- **Participants**
  - Experimental design
  - Implementation
  - Data and result disclosure

- **SICS**
  - Maintenance of standards
  - Interpretation boundaries
  - Regulatory and institutional responsibility

Track C participants remain **researchers and explorers only**.

---

## A Common Misconception About Team Composition

This program is **not** reserved for teams that already appear complete.

If you can answer “yes” to the following, participation is already valid:

- Can we responsibly address **at least one CAIS layer**?
- Are we willing to accept open comparison and validation?
- Can we accept that the outcome may not be success?

If so, the threshold is met.

---

## SICS Responsibility Boundary

- Standards, interpretation authority, regulatory boundaries: **SICS**
- Experimental design, implementation, data generation: **Participants**
- Publication, regulation, institutionalization: **Optional**
- Researchers are enabled to **remain researchers**
