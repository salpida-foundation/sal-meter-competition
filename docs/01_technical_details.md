## Purpose of this document

This document provides a **step-by-step technical orientation** to the  
**operational concept of the Sal-Meter system**.

Its purpose is to clarify:

- **What kinds of signals** Sal-Meter targets for measurement  
- **How measurement progresses across layers** within the CAIS architecture  
- **Where researchers and engineers may meaningfully design or contribute**

This document does **not** include design proposals, clinical claims,  
technical standards, or compliance conditions.

All technical definitions, mathematical formulations, normative criteria,  
and compliance requirements reside **exclusively** in  
**DOI-registered canonical documents**.

## System overview (summary)

Sal-Meter is a **research-oriented measurement system** that operates within  
the **CAIS (Consciousness–Aptamer Interface System)** architecture.

It converts biological and chemical state transitions into  
**non-subjective, reproducible signal data**.

Core components include:

- **Aptamer–iodine–based CAIS Layer-0 molecular interface**
- **Multi-oxidation-state iodine (redox) sensing**
- **Optical and electrochemical signal acquisition**
- **Index output through a defined computation pathway (VCE / CRI / CFI)**

This system **does not claim to measure subjective experience itself**.  
It targets **material and signal-level patterns that covary with internal state dynamics**.

## Overall operational flow (7-step overview)

---

### Step 1 · Biological sample acquisition  
#### (Initial implementation layer · Layer-0 Proof Phase)

In the initial research implementation phase,  
**low-burden, non-invasive biological samples** are used to validate:

- existence  
- reproducibility  
- stability  

of the CAIS Layer-0 signal-transduction structure.

#### Example sample types (illustrative only)

- Blood (small research-only volume)
- Saliva
- Breath condensate

Sample type and collection method depend on  
**research context, implementation constraints, and ethical approvals**.

This document **does not require, recommend, or fix** any specific sampling protocol.

#### Technical meaning of this step

The goal is **not** to determine which sample is “best.”

Rather, the objective is:

> **To demonstrate that the Aptamer–Iodine–based CAIS Layer-0  
> can transform biological state changes  
> into a reproducible signal space.**

The sample functions as a **temporary interface**.  
The core focus is the **molecular signal-transduction kernel behind it**.

---

### Aptamer G–Iodine is not a product, but a platform kernel

Aptamer G–Iodine is **not** a technology bound to a specific:

- sample type  
- device  
- form factor  

Instead, it is a **platform-level molecular kernel** that transforms:

- biological state
- redox dynamics
- molecular selectivity

into a **CAIS-compatible signal structure**.

Accordingly, this competition is **not** about building a finished product.

It is about:

> **Validating and fixing the Layer-0 kernel  
> that all future CAIS-compatible sensors must pass through.**

---

### Declaration on structural extensibility

While current validation relies on sample-based approaches,  
the Aptamer–Iodine CAIS Layer-0 architecture **does not structurally exclude**:

- contact-based skin sensors without sample extraction
- non-invasive proximity sensing
- long-term non-contact sensor architectures

These extensions are:

- **not promised**
- **not required**
- **not evaluated in the current phase**

but are **not fundamentally blocked** by the nature of the Layer-0 kernel.

---

### Long-term merit for participating researchers

Researchers contributing at this stage position themselves as:

- early implementers of the CAIS Layer-0 kernel
- reference origin contributors to the Aptamer–Iodine signal pathway
- technical coordinate points for future derived sensors and form factors

This is not a short-term performance contest.

It is participation at **the origin point of an entirely new measurement lineage**.

---

### Step 2 · Sample preprocessing

This step provides **baseline stabilization** prior to measurement.

Processes may include:

- centrifugation or fractionation
- particulate removal (filtration)
- dilution and buffering
- pH and temperature stabilization

Conditions depend on **device configuration and experimental design**.  
No specific preprocessing parameters are mandated here.

---

### Step 3 · Aptamer–Iodine interaction  
#### (CAIS Layer-0)

The core of CAIS lies in the **Layer-0 biochemical interface**.

At this stage:

- the aptamer structure responds to
- changes in iodine multi-oxidation states  
  (I⁻, I₂, I₃⁻, I₅⁻, etc.)
- producing **measurable physical signal events**

Layer-0:

- does **not** perform interpretation or diagnosis
- functions solely as a **pure signal-gating interface**

---

### Step 4 · Signal acquisition  
#### (Optical / Electrochemical)

Layer-0 reactions are captured via sensors.

Examples include:

- wavelength-specific optical absorption or transmission changes
- electrochemical potential or current variations
- hybrid sensing configurations

Output is **continuous numerical time-series data**.

---

### Step 5 · Signal processing

Sensor outputs undergo processing steps such as:

- noise reduction
- baseline correction
- environmental normalization
- temporal feature extraction

The purpose is **measurement stability**,  
not interpretation or evaluation.

---

### Step 6 · Index computation  
#### (Index Computation)

CFE⁺ addresses a structural gap in existing consciousness research by  
organizing consciousness along three information–energy axes:

- **OE (Ordered Energy):** structured informational energy
- **EE (Entropic Energy):** dissipative and destabilizing energy
- **RE (Relational Energy):** connective and synchronizing energy

From this architecture, three **canonical indices** are defined:

1. **VCE (Vibrational Consciousness Energy)**  
   Represents individual-level alignment and internal dynamics

2. **CRI (Consciousness Resonance Index)**  
   Measures relational and group-level resonance and synchronization

3. **CFI (Conscious Field Index)**  
   Represents large-scale social and civilizational field coherence

This document **does not redefine** any mathematical definitions or formulas.  
All authoritative definitions exist **only in DOI-registered canonical documents**.

### Step 7 · Output

Final output is provided as **structured data**.

  "VCE": 0.68,
