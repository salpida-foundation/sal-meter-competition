# Frequently Asked Questions (Extended FAQ)

This document answers common questions about the Sal-Meter Open Competition.
It is also intentionally designed to clarify **who this competition is for — and who it is not for**.

If any concern below is decisive for your participation, **Track C is the recommended default entry point**.

---

## 1. Governance, Judging, and the Role of SICS

### Q1. Who selects the judges?

**A.**  
The judging panel is constituted by **SICS (Salpida Institute of Consciousness Science)** and consists of **7–9 independent external experts** drawn from:

- Biosensors  
- Aptamer science  
- AI and machine learning  
- Statistics and validation science  
- Systems engineering  
- Ethics and governance  

**Independence requirements:**

- No financial interest in participating teams  
- No institutional affiliation with participating organizations during the competition  
- **SICS personnel cannot serve as technical judges**

---

### Q2. What exactly is SICS’s role?

**A.**  
SICS acts as a **constitutional and interpretive authority only**.

**SICS does:**

- Interpret canonical standards (CAIS, Sal-Meter definitions)
- Resolve disputes regarding rule interpretation
- Maintain non-drift of governance and standards

**SICS does not:**

- Score teams  
- Rank prototypes  
- Allocate research support or rewards  
- Influence technical evaluation outcomes  

In short: **SICS defines the rules but does not play the game.**

---

### Q3. Can SICS influence results indirectly?

**A.**  
No. This is intentionally prevented by design.

Safeguards include:

1. **Separation of powers**  
   - Rule interpretation (SICS) and scoring (independent judges) are institutionally separated  

2. **Conflict-of-interest exclusion**  
   - Judges with financial or institutional conflicts are excluded  

3. **Public traceability**  
   - Validation logic and results are published in open repositories  

4. **Dispute scope limitation**  
   - Only rule compliance may be reviewed  
   - Scores themselves are not renegotiated  

If this governance model is uncomfortable, participation beyond Track C is not recommended.

---

## 2. Validation and CRO Involvement

### Q4. Who performs final validation?

**A.**  
Final validation is conducted by an **independent Contract Research Organization (CRO)**.

The CRO’s role is strictly limited to **measurement execution**.

The CRO:

- Executes predefined validation protocols  
- Reports raw and processed data  

The CRO does **not**:

- Redefine CAIS metrics  
- Propose alternative interpretations  
- Certify or endorse systems  

Interpretive authority resides exclusively in the **canonical DOI-registered documents**.

---

### Q5. Is this clinical or medical validation?

**A.**  
No. This is intentional.

- This is **research-grade validation only**
- No diagnostic, therapeutic, or medical claims are permitted
- Regulatory or clinical pathways are explicitly out of scope

If your work requires clinical endpoints or regulatory approval, this competition is not suitable at this stage.

---

## 3. Team Structure and Eligibility

### Q6. Must Track A teams have exactly seven members?

**A.**  
No. Seven members is a **reference structure**, not a rigid requirement.

What matters is **coverage of roles**, not headcount:

- Biosensor / chemistry expertise  
- Signal processing or AI  
- Hardware engineering  
- Statistical validation  
- Project coordination  

Teams lacking one or more of these capabilities are unlikely to succeed in Track A.

---

### Q7. Can international or mixed-nationality teams participate?

**A.**  
Yes. There are **no nationality restrictions**.

International and multi-institutional teams are explicitly encouraged, provided coordination is feasible.

---

### Q8. Can students participate?

**A.**  
Yes — with role clarity.

- **Track A / B:**  
  - Senior researchers lead  
  - Students participate in supporting or scoped roles  

- **Track C:**  
  - Open to students, individuals, and exploratory contributors  

Track C is the recommended entry path for students or first-time participants.

---

## 4. Research Support, Costs, and IP Boundaries

### Q9. Can the provided support cover all research costs?

**A.**  
No.

Any support provided in this competition is **milestone-based research support**, not full project financing.

It is designed to:

- Enable meaningful research progress  
- Reward validated completion  

It is **not** designed to fully underwrite large teams or institutions.

If full cost coverage is required, participation beyond Track C is not recommended.

---

### Q10. Why is full funding intentionally avoided?

**A.**  
Because the goal is **signal validity and standard formation**, not institutional dependency.

This structure ensures:

- Serious teams self-select in  
- Symbolic or under-committed projects self-select out  
- Reduced risk of abandoned or superficial participation  

This is a **filter by design**, not a limitation by accident.

---

### Q11. What about patents and IP?

**A.**  
Yes — but only within fixed boundaries.

- Core standards (CAIS, Sal-Meter definitions, indices) remain **open** under CC BY-SA  
- Implementation-specific innovations may be published or protected independently  
- No retroactive IP ambiguity is permitted  

**Yes, but only if you respect the boundary.**  
If this is a concern, Track C is recommended instead.

---

## 5. Certification, Endorsement, and Common Misinterpretations

### Q12. Does SICS certify or endorse teams or devices?

**A.**  
No.

SICS:

- Does not certify devices  
- Does not endorse teams or products  
- Does not issue regulatory approvals  

Participation represents **research contribution**, not institutional endorsement.

---

### Q13. Is this a medical-device or commercialization pathway?

**A.**  
No.

This competition operates **strictly upstream of regulation and commercialization**.

Any downstream pathway would require:

- Independent redesign  
- Independent validation  
- Independent regulatory submission  

---

## 6. When This Competition Is Not a Good Fit

Participation is **not recommended** if:

- Immediate commercialization is required  
- Clinical claims are essential  
- Closed or proprietary standards are preferred  
- Only short-term, low-uncertainty projects are acceptable  

This competition favors **exploratory rigor over guaranteed outcomes**.

---

## 7. Bottom-Line Guidance

If your lab can allocate a **bounded, modular research effort** and operate within fixed open standards, participation is appropriate.

If governance constraints or uncertainty are a concern, **Track C is the rational default**.

Escalation to Track B or Track A remains optional and evidence-driven.
