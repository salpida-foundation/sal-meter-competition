# PI Quick Decision Pack  
## Sal-Meter Open Competition  
### Go / No-Go Brief for Principal Investigators

This document is written for Principal Investigators (PIs) and lab leads who need to decide—within approximately 30 minutes—whether participation in the Sal-Meter Open Competition is worth internal discussion or exploratory commitment.

No additional synthesis, proposal drafting, or reframing is required to use this document.

---

## What this competition is

- An international, open scientific program to explore **objective measurement of consciousness-like signals** under the CAIS (Consciousness–Aptamer Interface System) standard.
- A **research-grade, pre-regulatory initiative** focused on sensors, signal pipelines, and system-level validation.
- A framework where **definitions, governance, authorship, and IP boundaries are fixed in advance** through DOI-registered canonical documents.

This is a structured research environment, not an open-ended experiment.

---

## What this competition is not

- Not a startup accelerator or venture program  
- Not a commercialization or licensing initiative  
- Not a proprietary or closed platform  
- Not a clinical study or medical-claims project  

No diagnostic, therapeutic, or regulatory claims are expected or permitted at this stage.

---

## Governance and IP in one glance

- All canonical definitions and compliance requirements are fixed via DOI-registered documents.
- Core standards and reference designs remain open under CC BY-SA 4.0.
- Implementation-specific work may be published, credited, and extended independently.
- No retroactive IP claims, governance drift, or post hoc reinterpretation.

From a PI perspective, **institutional and reputational risk is explicitly bounded**.

## Risk–reward snapshot

| Dimension | Assessment |
|---------|------------|
| Scientific novelty | High |
| Scope control | High (modular participation) |
| Time commitment | Bounded and scalable |
| Career upside | Publications, standard-linked authorship, visible contribution |
| Reputational downside | Low (research-only, non-clinical) |
| IP ambiguity | Low (boundaries fixed upfront) |

This is not a binary “bet-the-lab” project.

---

## Minimum viable participation (Track C)

Track C is designed as the **default, low-risk entry path**.

- **Team size:** 1 PI / Postdoc / PhD researcher (+ optional MSc or engineer)
- **Time scale:** 3–6 months exploratory effort
- **Scope:** One clearly bounded module aligned with existing lab strengths
- **Commitment:** No obligation to pursue full system development

Escalation to Track B or Track A is optional and strictly data-driven.

---

## Expected academic outcomes

Depending on contribution scope, participation may yield:

- Methodology, prototype, or validation papers  
- Sensor, signal-processing, or system-architecture publications  
- Preprints or workshop papers related to consciousness-measurement interfaces  
- Explicit citation linkage to CAIS / CCF canonical standards

Participation may be listed as:

> “Sal-Meter CAIS Open Competition — Research Team Member”

---

## If the project does not progress

Even if a contribution does not mature into a full prototype:

- Partial sensor or signal pipelines remain reusable  
- Experimental protocols and datasets can be retained  
- Boundary-finding or negative results remain publishable  
- New grant-compatible research directions may emerge  

Participation is structured as a **learning-positive effort**, not a zero-sum outcome.

---

## Early participation and isolation risk

Early participation does **not** imply isolation.

- Multiple independent teams are evaluating or preparing exploratory entries.
- No single team is expected to implement the full CAIS stack.
- Contributions are modular by design and reviewed independently.

There is no “first-mover lock-in” risk.

---

## When participation is not recommended

This competition may not be suitable if:

- No modular research effort can be allocated
- Immediate clinical translation is required
- Fixed open standards are incompatible with lab policy
- Only short-term, low-uncertainty projects are acceptable

---

## Bottom-line decision rule

If your lab is interested in **objective measurement of mental or consciousness-related states**, and can allocate a small, modular exploratory effort, Track C participation is a rational default.

Escalation remains optional.

---

## Suggested next step if the answer is “maybe”

1. Read `docs/01_technical_details.md` (approximately 15 minutes).
2. Identify one module aligned with your lab’s strongest existing capability.
3. Decide internally whether a Track C exploratory contribution is feasible.

No further commitment is required at this stage.
