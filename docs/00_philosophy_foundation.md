## What this document is
This document explains **why** the Sal-Meter Open Competition exists.

It frames Sal-Meter not as “just a device,” but as a **civilizational experiment** —  
specifically, an experiment in **governance, measurement legitimacy, and implementation order**.

The questions this experiment asks are fundamental:

- Can consciousness function as a **measurable standard**, rather than a metaphor?
- Can **open governance** be fixed *before* technology is deployed?
- Can philosophy **survive contact with implementation** without collapsing into ideology?

## Quick extract (structural constraints summarized)
This document asserts no claims.  
It summarizes the **structural constraints already fixed elsewhere**:

- **CAIS Layer-0** requires iodine redox multi-oxidation sensing:  
  I⁻ → I₂ → I₃⁻ → I₅⁻
- **CAIS Layer-1** requires canonical output indices:  
  **VCE / CRI / CFI**, each in the 0–1.0 range, with timestamps
- **Independent CRO validation** is mandatory as a safety mechanism  
  (independent, public, reproducible)
- The core objective is **anti-capture governance**:  
  no single entity may monopolize consciousness measurement
