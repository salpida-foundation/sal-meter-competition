# Application Guide  
## Sal-Meter Open Competition

This document describes **how to apply** to the Sal-Meter Open Competition.

It is not a recruitment brochure.  
It is a procedural guide for teams that have already determined that participation
is appropriate for their current research stage.

For decision-making support, refer first to:

**PI Quick Decision Pack (2 pages)**  
`docs/PI_Quick_Decision_Pack.md`

That document is designed to support a PI-level Go / No-Go decision and may be
shared internally without modification.

## Purpose of This Guide

This guide exists to:

- Clarify what materials are expected in an application
- Reduce ambiguity in evaluation expectations
- Prevent misalignment between team readiness and track selection
- Avoid unnecessary submission effort for teams not yet prepared

It does **not** guarantee acceptance, priority, or funding.

## Overview of Participation Flow

Participation proceeds in three procedural stages:

1. **Pre-Application Review**  
   Familiarization with canonical constraints and internal feasibility assessment

2. **Application Package Preparation**  
   Assembly of required documents describing team, scope, and approach

3. **Submission**  
   Delivery of materials for independent review

There is no advantage to speed.  
Completeness and internal coherence matter more than timing.

---

## Stage 1: Pre-Application Review

### 1. Canonical Document Review

All applicants are expected to be familiar with the following
**canonical, DOI-registered documents**:

| Document | Role |
|--------|------|
| Sal-Meter Canonical Definition v1.0 | Defines what qualifies as a Sal-Meter |
| CAIS Compliance Boundary v1.0 | Defines mandatory technical and structural constraints |
| Competition Charter v1.0 | Defines governance, evaluation, and participation rules |
| Sal-Meter Negative Definition v1.0 | Defines what is explicitly excluded |

These documents fix the interpretive boundaries of the competition.
Applications that contradict them cannot be evaluated.

Track C participants may treat these as reference material.  
Track A and B participants are expected to align explicitly.

---

### 2. Internal Readiness Check

Before preparing materials, teams should confirm internally:

- The proposed contribution is **modular and bounded**
- The scope does not rely on undefined future hiring or funding
- At least one team member can act as a stable technical point of contact
- Open standards and non-exclusive core architecture are acceptable

If these conditions are not met, Track C participation is usually more appropriate.

---

## Stage 2: Application Package

Applications are evaluated as a **package**, not as isolated documents.

### Required Components

#### A. Team Overview (1–2 pages)

Include:

- Team name
- Current team size and roles
- Institutional or organizational context (if any)
- Relevant prior work (publications, systems, open-source, or prototypes)
- Motivation for participation (technical, not promotional)
- Primary contact person

The goal is clarity, not persuasion.

---

#### B. Team Member Profiles (1–2 pages per person)

Each profile should include:

- Name and current role
- Educational background
- Relevant experience
- Primary technical competencies
- Selected prior outputs (papers, systems, repositories)

Length and formatting consistency are preferred over detail density.

---

#### C. Technical Contribution Description (2–3 pages)

Describe **what you intend to build or contribute**, not what the project represents
philosophically.

Track-specific focus:

**Track A**
- System-level architecture
- Integration strategy across sensor, signal, and computation layers
- Validation approach within CAIS constraints
- Anticipated technical risks and mitigation

**Track B**
- Clearly defined component or module
- Interfaces to the broader CAIS architecture
- Expected outputs and reusability

**Track C**
- Area of exploration or contribution
- Expected artifacts (code, documentation, analysis, prototypes)
- Approximate time horizon

Claims should be testable.  
Speculative language should be avoided.

---

#### D. Resource Statement (Track A only)

Track A teams should include a **high-level resource statement** indicating that:

- The team can sustain the proposed scope through development and validation
- Dependencies and constraints are understood
- Participation does not rely on undefined future commitments

Detailed financial breakdowns are not required.
Exact cost figures are not used as evaluation criteria.

---

#### E. Optional Supporting Materials

May include:

- Selected publications or preprints
- Public repositories
- Prior systems or datasets
- Letters of institutional support (optional)

Optional materials do not compensate for gaps in required components.

---

## Stage 3: Submission

### Submission Method

Applications are submitted via email.

**Recipient:**  
contact@salpida.foundation

**Subject format:**  
`[Track A / B / C] Sal-Meter Open Competition – Team Name`

### Submission Notes

- Use clear, consistent file naming
- PDF format is preferred
- English is required for all materials
- Only complete submissions are reviewed

If revisions are necessary before review, teams may resubmit with a clear version note.

---

## After Submission

- Receipt confirmation is provided
- Review is conducted by independent evaluators
- Additional clarification may be requested if needed

Silence should not be interpreted as rejection or approval.
Evaluation proceeds asynchronously.

---

## When Not to Apply

This competition may not be appropriate if:

- Immediate clinical deployment is required
- Proprietary enclosure of core architecture is expected
- The work depends on unresolved regulatory positioning
- Only short-term, low-uncertainty outcomes are acceptable

Participation is voluntary and non-exclusive.
