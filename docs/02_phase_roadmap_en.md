# Development Roadmap: Phase-Based Progression Structure

This document defines the **phase-based progression structure** of the  
Sal-Meter Open Competition.

This is **not a promise of continuity**.  
Each phase is an **independent evaluation gate**.

Advancement is **earned**, not assumed.

---

## Overview: How Progression Works

- The competition is structured into **four sequential phases**
- **Passing a phase is mandatory** to enter the next
- Failure at any phase **terminates progression**
- There is no automatic continuation, extension, or appeal

This roadmap exists to **filter capability**, not to motivate participation.

---

## Phase 0 — Eligibility and Alignment Check

**Purpose:**  
Determine whether a team should participate at all.

**Status:**  
Pre-entry condition. No submission, no evaluation.

**Key Requirements:**

- Full understanding of all canonical documents
- Internal confirmation of role coverage and feasibility
- Acceptance of governance, IP, and validation boundaries

Teams unable to self-confirm alignment should default to **Track C**.

No feedback is provided at this stage.

---

## Phase 1 — Conceptual and Structural Evaluation

**Purpose:**  
Evaluate whether the proposed work is **structurally compatible** with Sal-Meter and CAIS.

**What is evaluated:**

- Conceptual coherence with CAIS definitions
- Proper scoping and modularity
- Technical realism of the proposal
- Role coverage and execution capacity

**What is NOT evaluated:**

- Novelty claims alone
- Prior reputation
- Institutional size or prestige

**Outcome Options:**

- **Pass:** Eligible to proceed to Phase 2  
- **Fail:** Progression ends  
- **Redirect:** Recommended downgrade to Track C or narrower scope

Passing Phase 1 does **not** imply future success.

---

## Phase 2 — Prototype Development and Internal Validation

**Purpose:**  
Demonstrate **actual execution capability**, not intent.

**Required Deliverables:**

- Functional prototype or component (track-dependent)
- Reproducible data outputs
- Documented methodology
- Clear CAIS alignment explanation

**Key Evaluation Criteria:**

- Functional completeness
- Signal stability and repeatability
- Transparency of implementation
- Internal validation rigor

**Common Failure Causes:**

- Over-scoped designs
- Non-reproducible results
- CAIS misinterpretation
- Dependency on undefined future work

Phase 2 failure ends progression.

---

## Phase 3 — Independent Validation (CRO)

**Purpose:**  
Verify that results hold **outside the originating team**.

**Validation Scope:**

- Execution of predefined validation protocols
- Measurement repeatability
- Data integrity and traceability

**Important Constraints:**

- CROs do not reinterpret results
- CROs do not certify devices
- CROs do not modify protocols

Only **measurement execution** is validated.

Failure at this stage ends progression permanently.

---

## Phase 4 — Canonical Recognition and Publication

**Purpose:**  
Acknowledge validated contributions within the open standard ecosystem.

**What this phase provides:**

- Public recognition of compliant implementation
- Inclusion in open repositories
- Citation eligibility

**What this phase does NOT provide:**

- Certification
- Commercial endorsement
- Regulatory approval
- Exclusive rights

Recognition reflects **compliance**, not superiority.

---

## Non-Negotiable Progression Rules

- No phase skipping
- No retroactive fixes
- No appeals on scoring outcomes
- No obligation to advance any team

This structure is designed to **self-select serious contributors**.

---

## Expected Timeline (Indicative Only)

| Phase | Typical Duration | Notes |
|------|------------------|-------|
| Phase 0 | Self-paced | No review |
| Phase 1 | 4–8 weeks | Proposal-level filtering |
| Phase 2 | 6–9 months | Execution-dependent |
| Phase 3 | 3–6 months | CRO scheduling dependent |
| Phase 4 | Post-validation | Publication only |

Timelines are indicative.  
Progression depends on **performance, not time**.

---

## Final Guidance

If your work:

- Requires guaranteed continuity  
- Depends on institutional backing  
- Assumes funding-driven success  

This roadmap is not compatible.

If your team can operate under **clear constraints, open standards, and binary evaluation**, progression is possible.
