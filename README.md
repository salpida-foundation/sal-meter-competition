# Sal-Meter Open Competition

Open global research competition to develop **objective consciousness-like signal
measurement systems** under the CAIS (Consciousness–Aptamer Interface System) standard.

This repository is a **non-authoritative operational index**.
All canonical definitions, governance rules, and authority are fixed exclusively in
DOI-registered documents.

## Before You Read Further

This is **not** a startup accelerator.  
This is **not** a product or commercialization program.  
This is **not** a medical or clinical device pathway.

This competition exists to test whether **consciousness-like signals can be measured
objectively**, reproducibly, and openly — and to fix those standards permanently.

If you are looking for funding, certification, endorsement, or clinical approval,
you should stop here.

## Start Here: PI-Level Go / No-Go (30 minutes)

If you are a **Principal Investigator or lab lead**, begin with the following document:

- **PI Quick Decision Pack — Go / No-Go Brief (Figshare, 2 pages)**  
  https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.31287268

This document is designed to support an internal **go / no-go decision within 30 minutes**
and may be forwarded directly to students or collaborators without modification.

A non-canonical markdown mirror is available here:
- docs/PI_Quick_Decision_Pack.md

## Core Entry Documents (Figshare)

The following three documents form the **entry layer** for this competition.
They are hosted on Figshare with DOIs and are accessible without registration.

1. **PI Quick Decision Pack (2 pages)**  
   https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.31287268

2. **Sal-Meter System Overview v1.0**  
   (Device concept, indices, measurement logic)  
   https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.31275067

3. **Sal-Meter Open Competition — Technical & Governance Snapshot v2.0**  
   (Tracks, evaluation structure, governance boundaries)  
   https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.31281835

This repository provides working markdown mirrors, discussions, and coordination only.
**Canonical authority does not reside here.**

## Minimal Kernel (M0) — Aptamer G-Iodine

This diagram defines the **Minimal Kernel (M0)** of the CAIS stack:
the Aptamer G-Iodine molecular Layer-0 core responsible for
signal gating prior to any interpretation, indexing, or inference.

The M0 kernel is not an application, device, or interpretation layer.
It exists solely as a **non-therapeutic signal interface** at the boundary
between biochemical state and measurable CAIS signals.

## CAIS Architecture & Sal-Meter Technical Snapshot v1.0

This document specifies the **system-level architecture** of CAIS-compatible
Sal-Meter implementations, including hardware boundaries, signal pathways,
and integration constraints required for reproducible development.

It serves as the **technical bridge** between the Minimal Kernel (M0)
and full system implementations.

## What This Competition Is

- An **international open research competition**
- Focused on **research-grade, pre-regulatory systems**
- Designed around **objective measurement of consciousness-like signals**
- Governed by **fixed, non-drifting standards** defined in advance
- Structured so that **partial, modular contributions are valid outcomes**

---

## What This Competition Is Not

- Not a venture or startup program  
- Not a medical device or diagnostic project  
- Not a commercialization or licensing pathway  
- Not a closed or proprietary platform  
- Not a certification or endorsement scheme  

---

## Participation Tracks (Self-Selection)

### Track A — Full System Development

For teams capable of delivering a complete, validated system.

If you are unsure whether your team qualifies for Track A, **you probably do not**.

- Multi-disciplinary, senior-led teams
- Full CAIS stack coverage required
- Independent validation required
- Milestone-based research support
- High risk, high rigor

Track A is intentionally difficult.

---

### Track B — Component Development

For teams contributing **clearly bounded subsystems**, such as:

- Signal processing algorithms  
- AI / inference models  
- Firmware or embedded control  
- Mobile / cloud interfaces  
- Validation tooling  

Track B rewards **depth over breadth**.

---

### Track C — Open Community (Default Entry)

For exploratory, academic, or first-time contributors.

- Individuals or small teams
- No funding dependency
- Self-paced, modular contributions
- Papers, prototypes, documentation, or code

**Track C is the recommended default entry point** if there is any uncertainty.

Escalation to Track B or A remains optional and evidence-driven.

---

## Canonical Authority (Mandatory)

All participants must comply with the following **four DOI-registered canonical documents**.
These documents override any interpretation derived from this repository.

| # | Document | DOI |
|---|---------|-----|
| 1 | Sal-Meter Canonical Definition v1.0 | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18452075 |
| 2 | CAIS Compliance Boundary v1.0 | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18452269 |
| 3 | Sal-Meter Open Competition Charter v1.0 | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18452453 |
| 4 | Sal-Meter Negative Definition v1.0 | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18452694 |

Failure to read and comply with these documents results in **automatic disqualification**.

---

## Research Scope and Medical Claims

This competition is strictly **research-only**.

- No medical or clinical claims  
- No diagnostic or therapeutic use  
- No regulatory submission in scope  

Any downstream medical or commercial pathway requires **independent redesign,
independent validation, and independent regulatory review**.

---

## Governance and the Role of SICS

The Salpida Institute of Consciousness Science (SICS):

- Interprets canonical documents
- Maintains governance consistency
- Resolves rule-interpretation disputes

SICS does **not**:

- Score teams  
- Rank outcomes  
- Certify devices  
- Endorse products  
- Approve commercialization  

SICS defines the rules.  
Independent judges evaluate technical outcomes.

## How Participation Typically Proceeds

1. Read the **PI Quick Decision Pack**
2. Review the **four canonical DOI documents**
3. Identify one **bounded contribution**
4. Decide Track C / B / A internally
5. Engage via GitHub Discussions
6. Submit application if applicable

There is no obligation to escalate beyond Track C.

## Final Note

This competition is designed to **filter, not persuade**.

If the structure feels restrictive, uncertain, or insufficiently funded,
**non-participation is a valid and expected outcome**.

If your lab values exploratory rigor, open standards, and measurable progress,
Track C is the rational default.
