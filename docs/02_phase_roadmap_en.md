Initial manuscript submissions to academic journals

Phase 3: Validation Stage (April–September 2027)
Duration: 6 months
Goal: Complete independent validation

CRO (Contract Research Organization) Role
Step 1: Participant Recruitment
Total Participants: 50

Participant Distribution:

25 participants: Expected high VCE (high stress/activation state)

25 participants: Expected low VCE (relaxed state)

Step 2: Baseline Assessment
Assessment Components:

Basic health screening

Mental health questionnaire

Baseline measurements

Step 3: Measurement Protocol
Protocol Overview:

Minimum 3 measurements per participant (in varying states)

Simultaneous evaluation using standard reference tools (comparison)

Blinded assessment (measurer unaware of participant's state)

Step 4: Data Analysis
Sensitivity Validation
Can the device correctly identify ≥20 of the 25 participants known to be in high-stress state?

Target: ≥80%

Specificity Validation
Can the device correctly identify ≥21 of the 25 participants in relaxed state as non-stressed?

Target: ≥85%

Additional Statistical Validation
Confidence intervals

p-value calculations

Reproducibility assessment

Step 5: Report Writing
Report Components:

Methodology fully disclosed

All data made public

Negative findings included

Results Dissemination
All data uploaded to GitHub

Manuscript registered on OSF (Open Science Framework)

Submitted to independent peer-reviewed journal

Phase 4: Regulatory Pathway & Multi-Site Validation (October 2027+)
Goal: Achieve international recognition and regulatory approval

Key Activities
1. Regulatory Consultation
Regional Pathways:

FDA (USA): Class II or III medical device pathway

EMA (European Union): CE marking application

MFDS (South Korea): Medical device approval

PMDA (Japan): Japanese regulatory pathway

2. Multi-Site Validation
Validation Scope:

Simultaneous validation at 3–5 independent institutions

Expansion to diverse demographics (ethnicity, age, gender)

Multi-regional data collection

3. Clinical Trial Planning
Trial Phases:

Phase I: Safety testing (20–50 participants, 3–6 months)

Phase II: Efficacy testing (100–300 participants, 6–12 months)

Phase III: Large-scale efficacy validation (1,000+ participants, 1–2 years)

Phase IV: Post-market surveillance (ongoing)

4. Regulatory Submission
Required Documentation:

Phase I/II/III data dossier

Safety report

Technical documentation

Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) documentation

Expected Outcomes
Regional regulatory approvals (2027–2031)

Official medical device certification

Clinical deployment authorization
